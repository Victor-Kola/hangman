# Victor's Hangman Game 
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

This is my version of the classic Hangman game that looks to bring everything I've learnt so far at AiCore together. I am looking ot incorporate several foundational python techniques.

File structure of the project - There is a file for each milestone and we aim to bring it all together in the end. 
License information - There is no license it is free for all. 

We have updated milestone 3 to create two functions that wil ask our user for their input and check if their input is in the random word we have generated. What we have learned so far is how to convert words to lowercase, define functions and also utilising while and for loops.
